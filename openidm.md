OpenIDM is an open standards based Identity Management, Provisioning and Compliance solution. Enables you to consolidate multiple identity sources for policy and workflow-based management. OpenIDM can consume, transform and feed data to external sources so that you maintain control over the identities of users, devices and other objects.

Experience shows that the most important features of an identity management product are: high flexibility in         Business Process handling and compliance with open standards and interfaces.
A highly flexible user interface combined with a very robust workflow engine make OpenIDM ready for any Identity Management project.

OpenIDM provides a modern UI experience that allows you to manage your data without writing a single line of code. The standard RESTful interfaces also offer ultimate flexibility so that you can customize and develop the product to fit the requirements of your deployment.
