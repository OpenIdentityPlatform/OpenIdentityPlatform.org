<h1><a href="https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ">OpenDJ</a></h1>

OpenDJ is an LDAPv3 compliant directory service, which has been developed for the Java platform, providing a high performance, highly available, and secure store for the identities managed by your organization. Its easy installation process, combined with the power of the Java platform makes OpenDJ the simplest, fastest directory to deploy and manage.

* **High Performance**. Lots of features are important, but performance is almost always near the top of the list. It needs to be extremely fast, outperforming all other servers wherever possible.

* **Vertical Scalability**  OpenDJ is capable of handling billions of entries in a single instance on appropriately-sized hardware. It can make effective use of multi-CPU, multi-core machines with hundreds of gigabytes of memory.

* **Horizontal Scalability** OpenDJ supports Multi-Master replication to support horizontal scalability to provide fast read and write access to large amounts of data.

* **Supportability** OpenDJ is easy to support and maintain. The administration is almost intuitive and provides various powerful tools to manage and monitor OpenDJ instances.

* **Synchronization** OpenDJ supports data synchronization between instances, including not only total data synchronization but also partial synchronization (with fractional, filtered, and subtree capabilities)
